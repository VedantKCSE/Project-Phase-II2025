## 🧠 Problem Statement

Navigating college admissions after competitive exams like **JEE** and **NEET** can be overwhelming for students and parents. The lack of centralized, rank-based, quota-specific college information adds to the confusion.

To bridge this gap, I developed two Android apps:
- **JEE Saral** – for engineering aspirants
- **NEET Saral** – for medical aspirants

These apps assist students in filtering colleges based on rank, category, quota, and other admission parameters – providing a **personalized and guided experience**.
